# Generated-code-has-been-predicted
In the Efficient-Code-Generation-with-E-Code work, the authors used a fine-tuned pre-trained model to predict a series of codes to be generated. 
Due to the need for comparative experiments, there are three code generation models. 
The three code generation models are E-code 350M, GPT-Neo 125M and No expert group E-code 350M. 
Each of them is described below.


## E-code 350M

## GPT-Neo 125M

## No expert group E-code 350M
