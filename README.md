# Generated-code-has-been-predicted
In the Efficient-Code-Generation-with-E-Code work, the authors use a fine-tuned pre-trained model to predict a range of codes to be generated. 
Due to the need for comparative experiments, three code generation models are available. 
The three code generation models are E-code 350M, GPT-Neo 125M, and No expert group E-code 350M. 
We use each of the three fine-tuned code generation models to generate codes. 
Below we have [the code generated by the three fine-tuned code generation models](https://github.com/CodeGeneration2/Generated-code-has-been-predicted/tree/main/Generated-code-has-been-predicted).


## E-code 350M
We give [the results of 3 times code generation in the E-code 350M model](https://github.com/CodeGeneration2/Generated-code-has-been-predicted/tree/main/Generated-code-has-been-predicted/E-code%20350M).


## GPT-Neo 125M
We give [the case results of one code generation for the GPT-Neo 125M model](https://github.com/CodeGeneration2/Generated-code-has-been-predicted/tree/main/Generated-code-has-been-predicted/GPT-Neo%20125M).


## No expert group E-code 350M
We give [the case results of one code generation for the no expert group E-code 350M model](https://github.com/CodeGeneration2/Generated-code-has-been-predicted/tree/main/Generated-code-has-been-predicted/No%20expert%20group%20E-code%20350M).
