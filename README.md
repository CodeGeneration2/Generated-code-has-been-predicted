# Generated-code-has-been-predicted
In the Efficient-Code-Generation-with-E-Code work, the authors used a fine-tuned pre-trained model to predict a series of codes to be generated. 
Due to the need for comparative experiments, there are three code generation models. 
The three code generation models are E-code 350M, GPT-Neo 125M and No expert group E-code 350M. 
Each of them is described below.


## E-code 350M
We give [the results of 3 times code generation in the E-code 350M model](https://github.com/CodeGeneration2/Generated-code-has-been-predicted/tree/main/Generated-code-has-been-predicted/E-code%20350M).


## GPT-Neo 125M
We give [the case results of one code generation for the GPT-Neo 125M model](https://github.com/CodeGeneration2/Generated-code-has-been-predicted/tree/main/Generated-code-has-been-predicted).


## No expert group E-code 350M
We give [the case results of one code generation for the no expert group E-code 350M model](https://github.com/CodeGeneration2/Generated-code-has-been-predicted/tree/main/Generated-code-has-been-predicted).
